# youves-oracle-jobs

youes utilizes the [Acurast oracles](https://github.com/acurast) and the [youves oracle contract](https://github.com/youves-com/youves-smart-contract/blob/main/contracts/oracle/) for the price feeds of the synthetic assets.

The oracle scripts are the executables used by the processors to collect data in a verifiable way.

Among other things the youves_oracle_script.js is the one used in production also to calculate the DEFI index value.
