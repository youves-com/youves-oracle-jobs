# youves-oracle-jobs

youes utilizes the [ubinetic oracles](https://github.com/ubinetic) and the [ubinetic oracle contract](https://github.com/ubinetic/ubinetic-oracles-contract) for the price feeds of the synthetic assets.

The oracle scripts are the executables used by our data transmitters to collect data in a verifiable way.

Among other things the youves_oracle_script.js is the one used in production also to calculate the DEFI index value.
